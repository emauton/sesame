# CircleCI setup for Erlang based originally on Parroty's for Elixir:
#   https://parroty00.wordpress.com/2014/06/29/elixir-on-circleci/
# In concert with the Makefile, this ensures that lint, xref, dialyzer
# etc. get run on the project as part of CI as well as testing.
#
# A Debian package and EDoc are stored as build artifacts.
